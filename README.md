Problem Statement: 

3) How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology.

Our Proposed Solution: 
- provide a method of identification of struggling users by having them anonymously self-identify
  - add functionality to "get a hint"
  - add functionality to "provide an example/alternative"
  - add functionality to "request more explanation from the instructor" 
  - each of these would be an 'indicator of struggling user'
- on top of this self-identification, gather usage statistics and use machine learning to identify struggling users without them needing to self-identify for the instructor to potentially intervene
