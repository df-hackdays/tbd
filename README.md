Problem Statements: 
2) How do we empower Canadians with lower digital literacy levels or who are intimidated by technology to understand the importance of digital literacy for themselves or their children?

Our Proposed Solution:
- provide meaningful content that is relevant to the demographic
  - eg. essays (for school-aged children)
  - eg. finacial statements, budgets, etc. for adults
- start from familiar --> code
 
3) How do we manage a room of learners with different experience levels and learning speeds? CLC would like to provide support for mentors and instructors to identify learners that are struggling with pace and are not comfortable publicly voicing it. Please also consider ease of use for children or those that are newer to technology.

Our Proposed Solution:
